# About me

My name is Daniel Joven and I have been a Linux system administrator for 6 years. During these years, I have mainly worked on Zentyal, providing official support for clients and collaborating in the management of their IT infrastructure. In addition to this client, I have also worked on other projects performing tasks such as:

* Creation and management of web hosting with cPanel, Plesk, and ISPconfig.
* Automation of tasks with Ansible and bash scripting.
* Design, creation, and maintenance of a cloud environment in AWS.
* Design, creation, and maintenance of CI/CD for development, staging, and production environments.

Furthermore, since I started my training in IT, I have been able to obtain the following certifications:

* (2015) Zentyal Certified Associate 3.2.
* (2015) Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA).
* (2016) Linux Professional Institute Certification 201.
* (2017) Mysql database Administrator 5.6.
* (2018) Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE).
* (2019) Red Hat Certified Specialist in Ansible Automation.
* (2022) Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA).

With the experience gained during these years, I have decided to create a complete project with Zentyal and AWS and share it to help - hopefully - other IT members who are considering or have problems in implementing a production environment with Zentyal.
